# Getting Started

<br>

## 📘 Introduction

This project is a microcontroller-based catapult system powered by an Arduino UNO R4. It allows users to adjust the horizontal angle of the catapult using a potentiometer or smartphone and control various motorized components like a stepper motor and DC motor to prepare and fire projectiles. A mobile app communicates with the Arduino via Bluetooth using Serial Port Protocol (SPP) for remote control and monitoring.

<br>

## 🌟 Features

- **Analog User Input**: Potentiometer-based angle adjustment for intuitive user control.
- **Stepper Motor Control**: Precision horizontal rotation based on angle feedback.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Second potentiometer reads the actual catapult angle for real-time display and motion syncing.
- **LCD Output**: Displays current rotational angle for user feedback.
- **Bluetooth SPP Communication**: Mobile app interface to control and trigger various mechanisms.
- **DC Motor Wind-up System**: Prepares the firing mechanism.
- **Firing System**: Launches projectile using a pneumatic actuator.

<br>

## 🚀 Future Plans

- **Trajectory Calculation**: Predict and visualize shot arcs based on angle and tension.
- **Mobile App Enhancements**: Expand mobile interface with more feedback and control options.

## 📦 Installation

### Arduino IDE

1. Download and install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/catapult-controller.git
cd catapult-controller
```

3. Open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.
4. Select the correct board: **Arduino UNO R4**
5. Upload the code to your board.

<br>

## 📖 Usage

### Running the System

1. Power on the Arduino UNO R4 and ensure motors are connected.
2. Adjust the first potentiometer to select the horizontal firing angle.
3. The stepper motor will rotate the catapult to match the selected angle.
4. View the live angle feedback on the LCD.
5. Open the mobile app and connect to the Arduino via Bluetooth SPP.
6. Use app buttons to:
   - Change horizontal firing angle
   - Wind the DC motor (pull back firing arm)
   - Trigger the pneumatic actuator (fire)


### Example command flow:

1. Open Bluetooth app and connect to device.
2. Adjust angle
3. Tap `Wind` to activate DC motor.
4. Tap `Fire` to trigger the pneumatic cylinder.
5. Repeat as needed.
